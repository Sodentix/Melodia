- [ ] Admin user management
- [ ] User account suspension/deactivation
- [ ] Audit logs for admin actions
- [ ] User statistics and analytics
- [ ] Bulk user operations

### 7. Frontend Authentication Components

**Priority: High**

#### Login/Signup Forms
- [ ] Enhanced signup form with validation
- [ ] Login form with "Remember me" option
- [ ] Forgot password form
- [ ] Password strength indicator
- [ ] Real-time validation feedback

- [ ] Login history display
- [ ] Device management interface
- [ ] MFA setup interface

#### Security Components
- [ ] Password change form
- [ ] Email change form with verification
- [ ] Account deletion confirmation
- [ ] Two-factor authentication setup

### 8. Database Enhancements

**Priority: Medium**

#### User Model Extensions
```javascript
// Additional fields to add to User model
{
  firstName: String,
  lastName: String,
  avatar: String,
  preferences: {
    theme: String,
    notifications: Boolean,
    language: String
  },
  lastLogin: Date,
  loginHistory: [{
    ip: String,
    userAgent: String,
    timestamp: Date,
    location: String
  }],
  trustedDevices: [{
    deviceId: String,
    deviceName: String,
    lastUsed: Date
  }],
  securityQuestions: [{
    question: String,
    answer: String // hashed
  }],
  mfaEnabled: Boolean,
  totpSecret: String,
  backupCodes: [String]
}
```

#### Audit Logs
- [ ] Create AuditLog model
- [ ] Log all authentication events
- [ ] Log profile changes
- [ ] Log security-related actions

### 9. Testing & Documentation

**Priority: Medium**
